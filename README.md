# Optimizing-Vehicle-Purchase-Decisions-A-Data-Driven-Risk-Analysis-for-Carvana

This project delves into Carvana's challenges in minimizing "bad buys," vehicles that end up being unprofitable due to defects, title issues, or other problems. Leveraging data from the "Don't Get Kicked!" Kaggle competition, the analysis focuses on identifying patterns that can help Carvana improve its vehicle acquisition strategy.

Through a series of Tableau dashboards, we explore the relationship between key vehicle attributes, auction dynamics, and geographic trends in order to derive actionable insights for minimizing bad buys and enhancing Carvana’s operational efficiency.

**Dashboard Overview**
1. Introduction & Overview Dashboard : Provides a high-level snapshot of the dataset, highlighting key metrics like total vehicles analyzed, percentage of bad buys, and average acquisition cost.
2. Vehicle Characteristics Analysis Dashboard : Analyze how factors like vehicle age, odometer reading, make, and model contribute to the likelihood of a bad buy.
3. Auction Performance Analysis Dashboard : Evaluate the performance of auction providers and different sales channels.
4. Geographical Analysis Dashboard : Visualize geographic distribution of bad buys across different states and ZIP codes.
5. Cost and Pricing Analysis Dashboard : Compare acquisition costs, market prices, and warranty costs to determine profitability and identify patterns in bad buys.

**Key Insights and Recommendations**
1. High-Risk Vehicles: Older, high-mileage vehicles, especially from specific manufacturers, are more likely to be bad buys. Prioritizing reliable, low-mileage models can significantly lower this risk.
2. Auction and Sales Channels: Certain auction providers, particularly those with weaker guarantees, contribute more to bad buys. Online purchases also carry higher risk, indicating a need for stricter evaluation in these channels.
3. Geographic Trends: Bad buys are concentrated in specific regions. By targeting acquisitions in lower-risk areas, Carvana can enhance inventory quality.
4. Pricing Challenges: Bad buys often have inflated acquisition costs relative to market value. Implementing rigorous pricing checks can prevent overpaying for risky inventory.

**Conclusion**

This analysis reveals key factors behind Carvana’s “bad buys” and offers data-driven strategies to minimize these risks while boosting profitability. By focusing on vehicle attributes, auction dynamics, geographic trends, and pricing metrics, we identify actionable steps to refine Carvana’s acquisition process.

**Strategic Recommendations**

1. Elevate Sourcing Standards: Focus acquisitions on vehicles with better reliability and lower mileage.
2. Optimize Auction Selection: Prioritize auction providers with strong guarantees and improve due diligence for online channels.
3. Use Geographic Targeting: Source from regions with historically lower bad buy rates.
4. Enhance Pricing Discipline: Apply strict pricing evaluations to ensure acquisitions align with market value.
